# Omnipedia
The encyclopedia wiki NOSTR client, 
from everyone to everyone.

I don't know how to program, 
I created this page to see 
if it's possible to come up 
with something just with ideas.

Some Ideas:

1 - Everyone can create articles, but there is a system of reputation and complaints.

2 - The original creator of the article becomes the admin.

3 - You can create more than one article for the same theme and each one will have a "note" address.

4 - The article can be repeated if you change at least one character. But if it is very similar to an older one, it will have a copy percentage marking, pointing to the original.

5 - Articles for the same topic will be highlighted according to their relevance in a structure of pages "from 1 to ‚Ä¶", where the most relevant will be shown directly.

6 - Articles can be flagged in depth levels: #Layperson, #Academic and #Thesis.

7 - Articles will be separated into languages, like wikipedia, but can be translated by collaborators to be available in more than one language, although they may have different levels of relevance in each language.

8 - The paragraphs have very discreet buttons for positive, negative, comments and zaps, which only appear when accessed on the side.

9 - It will be possible to listen to the narrated article in different languages and narrations. From AI to a real narrator.

10 - Hierarchy of truth:

- Each user has a limit of text they can write without paying, after that limit they will have to pay a small amount to write. This is a way to keep the client up and running and filter out malicious users.
- When articles refer to people, if the person is alive, they can create an article about themselves and it will have a separate highlight level [Biography?].
- The quantity and quality of the references will signal a level of foundation of the article (no foundation, little foundation, well foundation). With each reference being flagged as incorrect/inaccurate, weak or good, with symbols: ‚ùåÔ∏è üüß üü©
- There will be a history button that will allow you to consult all the changes in each article.
